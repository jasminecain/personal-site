#personal-site

### Description:
This website is a personal portfolio site to house information about me and all my projects as a Junior Software Developer.

### Prerequisites
- Node v6.11.0
- NPM >= v5.3.0

### Spin up
```bash
http -server
```
### Staging

You'll need a server to run my personal website in your browser, if you don't have one installed, [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) is a quick option.

```bash
npm install --save http-server
```
Then open a new terminal tab and run:

```bash
hs -o
```
